        <p>
          I did this workshop with AllWomen academy and ladies from 10 different countries are joined. I am so happy about it, and I am looking forward to do the feedback session.
        </p>

        <p>
          We had even a lady from Mexico! And time for her was 12:25! I cannot believe that so many people are united from so many different countries to learn and take first step in coding.
